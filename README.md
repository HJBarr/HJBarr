# Splunk Project

### In this splunk sceneario I use splunk to analyze a simulated attack  


# First Part Of Attack Windows Server Log

After Here we can se a spike on high severity which means there was a type of attack

After further analysing them we found a suspices spike on faild activities and on succesful log ins which leads me to belive that access was gained thru brute force 

Faild activities

2 Signatures had big increase after the attack those being accounts being locked out and attempts being made to reset a users password and 2 users also stood out 
This activitie lead me to belive that thru the brute force attack they gained access to this accounts and chnaged this users passwords for easeier access

 # Second Part Of Attack Apache Web Server (linux machine)

After analyzing the logs I encounter a surge on POST going from 106 to 1324 and a decrease in GET from 9851 to 3157 as well as an increase on Code 404 going from 213 to 679 all this data makes me belive there was a DDoS attack on the web server

Decrease on website visits

After ![Screenshot (99)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/068429c6-3f7a-4336-af68-cb3388160809)

After looking at the URI I was able to pinpoint the attack to the /VSI_Account_logon.php we can see that the POST request match to it which means the DDoS attack was oerform on the logon page

I was also able to use a cluster map to see where the main concentration of POST request where coming from Ukraine

# Incident Summary 
## Brute Force Attack on user_J:
- Attackers successfully compromised user_Jâ€™s account by conducting a brute force attack, likely due to weak credentials or insufficient account security measures.
## Lateral Movement to Apache Server:
- Using the access gained through user_J, the attackers moved laterally to the Apache server. This may have been achieved through credential reuse, privilege escalation, or exploiting misconfigurations.
## DDoS Attack via POST Requests:
- Once in control of the Apache server, the attackers launched a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, targeting the /VSI_Account_logon.php endpoint with POST requests to exhaust server resources.
